# BLB-Draft-Analysis
Card Analysis of the Magic The Gathering Bloomburrow set for the draft game mode. Allows players to create more informed decisions when selecting cards.

## Data Collection
Data on all legal cards in the draft game mode from the Magic The Gathering Bloomburrow set scraped from <a href=Scryfall.com>Scryfall.com</a> with card rankings from <a href=cardgamebase.com>cardgamebase.com</a>.

Tools:
<ul>

  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>requests</li>
  <li>BeautifulSoup</li>
  <li>time</li>
  <li>pickle</li>
</ul>


## Data Visualization
The collected data was engineered to allow more specific sorting with special attention given to the 'text' of the card to extract the card's abilities. From there, visualizations were produced to show the differences between the colours (types) in the draft game mode.
